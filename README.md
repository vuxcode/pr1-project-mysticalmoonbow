# Project Instructions
Follow the instructions here: https://vuxcode.netlify.app/new/pr1/lessons/major-project-brief/

REMEMBER TO "COMMIT" YOUR CHANGES REGULARLY TO SHOW HOW YOU HAVE BUILT THIS PROJECT! 

The final program is not the goal! The aim of the project is to show how you have developed your program, the steps you have taken and the problems you have solved!

# Project Notes

> You can use this section of the file to keep notes about your project as you work on it.

# Project Summary

> Before the final submission date you should include a "PROJECT SUMMARY" in this section here. 

I wanted my website to kind of look like a personal website. I wanted it to have some information about the project and a page for the program I made in JavaScript.

Since I already had some experience in HTML and CSS before I thought that part would be the easiest and that I would struggle with JavaScript but it was the other way around.

If I had more time I would've added images to the website. My plan was to add a digital sketch of the website to go alongside the "Planning Of The Project". I also wanted to add an image/screenshot of my Sudoku game next to or in the same card as "My Sudoku Game". I also would've focused more on accessibility. I really wanted to make a responsive design but found that it was way more difficult than I thought and chose to focus on other things instead.

I did not manage to stick to the budget. I worked for ca 20 hours and 30 min on Programming and ca 25 hours and 30 min on Web Development. In the beginning it was way easier to work on the programming project, probably because I had a clear outline of what every step was going to be. Even though I came across some issues I still knew what I needed to work on. Since I didn't have a clear idea of what I wanted the website to look like, I didn't feel as motivated or inspired to work on it and focused more on my program in the earlier stages. But near the end of the course, when I felt pretty content with my program, I shifted focus to the website.

# User Guide

> Write a clear user guide for how someone should use your program.

Click on an available box and enter your guess in the prompt. If you press "ok", the box will be updated with your input. If you press "cancel" nothing will happen. If you want to check if your answers are right, click on the validate button. The boxes will either turn red if they're wrong or green if they're right. If a box has turned green after being validated you won't be able to click it again. If you want to clear a box you can do so by clicking it, not enter anything, and click "ok".
