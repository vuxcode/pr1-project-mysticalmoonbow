        <p class="about">I chose to combine the Major Project of the Web Development and Programming courses and create something akin to a personal website. The goal of the project was to try and cover as much of the course criteria in one project as possible. This is the result.</p>

          <h2>Planning Of The Project</h2>
          <p>I already had some basic knowledge in HTML and CSS but none in JavaScript. I struggled a lot with the planning of the website. I looked at a lot of inspiration but I still had no clear idea of what I wanted it to look like. I just knew that I wanted the website to be easy to navigate and preferably that there was a consistent theme on all the pages.</p>

          <h2>My Sudoku Game</h2>
          <p>For the programming part of the project I decided to make a Sudoku game. I've liked Sudoku ever since I was little and thought it would be a nice challange to try and make one myself. Click <a href="sudoku.html">here</a> to play and read more about it!</p>
